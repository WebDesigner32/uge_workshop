Well, let us see...

I have taken a lot of notes, so I can just rely on those.

New branch - git branch
Make branch active - git checkout

This is important. How do we open a file? Easy, if you are in the directory, then it is just subl . from the terminal to open up in Sublime Text. You can modify there. Now, you can just do subl <filename> too.

Worth mentioning, your terminal history has been saved as Important Class Notes.
